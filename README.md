Summary
Foodie is an app designed to inspire users with new and exciting recipes based on the food they already have. A user simply snaps a picture of their spare food, and Foodie uses advanced machine learning to predict what food items are in that picture. If the app gets it wrong, users have the ability to correct the list of items that the app returned. When the list of the user's food items is complete, the user then submits the list and the app returns a list of recipes that incorporate the food items from the list.

Technology used:
CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Clarifai API, Edamam API

Future features/stretch goals:
Upcoming features include displaying nutritional values on recipe cards, displaying a thumbnail of the user's uploaded picture (on both the homepage and the ingredients page)
